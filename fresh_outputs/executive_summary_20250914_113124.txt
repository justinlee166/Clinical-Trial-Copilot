Executive Summary

This observational comparative study investigated the linguistic performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to human language processing, involving 1,200 participants with a focused comparison group of 80 humans. The research centered on grammaticality judgment tasks, evaluating multiple LLM versions including ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bard.

Key findings demonstrate that while ChatGPT-4 achieved impressive accuracy (93.5%) on grammatical sentences, surpassing human performance, it significantly underperformed humans when identifying ungrammatical sentences. This performance gap widened with repeated exposure to the same stimuli, suggesting fundamental differences in how LLMs and humans process language. Notably, larger model sizes did not consistently correlate with improved performance, challenging assumptions about scaling effects on language processing capabilities.

Clinical Implications: These findings have significant implications for the deployment of LLMs in healthcare settings where language precision is crucial. The study suggests that current LLMs, despite their sophisticated capabilities, lack the robust linguistic processing mechanisms inherent in human cognition. Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when implementing LLM-based solutions for tasks requiring nuanced language understanding, particularly in clinical documentation or patient communication where grammatical accuracy is essential.
