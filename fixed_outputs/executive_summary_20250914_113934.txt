Executive Summary

This observational comparative study evaluated the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) versus human participants in grammaticality judgment tasks, with particular focus on ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, and Bard compared against 80 human subjects. The findings reveal a complex pattern of AI language processing capabilities: while ChatGPT-4 achieved superior accuracy (93.5%) on grammatical sentences compared to humans, it demonstrated notably inferior performance on ungrammatical sentences and showed less stable responses overall. This pattern suggests fundamental differences in how AI and human brains process language.

Key clinical implications indicate that despite significant advances in LLM scaling, current AI models lack the consistent linguistic judgment capabilities inherent to human language processing. This has important ramifications for healthcare applications relying on LLMs for language-critical tasks, such as medical documentation or patient communication. The study's findings suggest that while LLMs can be powerful tools for healthcare professionals, they should not be relied upon as standalone systems for tasks requiring nuanced grammatical judgment or linguistic analysis without human oversight.

Actionable recommendations include: (1) implementing human verification processes for LLM-generated content in clinical settings, (2) developing specialized validation protocols for healthcare-specific language tasks, and (3) maintaining awareness of the current limitations of LLMs in processing ungrammatical or irregular language patterns. These findings are particularly relevant for healthcare organizations developing AI-driven documentation or communication systems.
