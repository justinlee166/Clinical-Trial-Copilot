The present work investigates whether model scaling mitigates such differences.\n\nThe study found that larger LLMs (ChatGPT-4) performed better than smaller LLMs (Bard and ChatGPT-3.5) on the grammaticality judgment task, but the results were affected by the fact that Bard and ChatGPT-4 were tested after ChatGPT-3.5's results were made public.\n\nOverall, the results show that the LLMs performed well in grammaticality judgment tasks, but there were differences in their performance compared to humans.\n\n{'key_findings': 'ChatGPT-4 outperforms other language models in accuracy and stability, particularly in ungrammatical sentences.', 'results': 'ChatGPT-4 reaches a high level of accuracy (93.5%) for grammatical sentences and performs above chance level for ungrammatical sentences.'}\n\n{'key_findings': 'The study found that model size does not necessarily correlate with performance improvement over repetitions. ChatGPT-4, the best-performing LLM, showed improvement in a condition where ChatGPT-3.5 worsened. The study also found no evidence that response stability changes over repeated presentations of the same sentence.', 'results': 'The study found that the GLMM for accuracy including the interaction between model and condition is further improved by adding a parameter for repetitions. The study also found that the addition of any repetition effect did not improve the GLMM for stability.'}\n\nChatGPT-4 achieves higher accuracy than humans, but is less accurate for ungrammatical sentences and has less stable responses.\n\nshow that even the best-performing model in our analyses, ChatGPT-4, does not behave comparably to humans: ChatGPT-4’s accuracy rate in grammatical sentences surpasses that of human subjects, but it is lower than that of humans on ungram- matical stimuli, where it further decreases upon repeated exposure\n\nThe study found that while language models (LLMs) surpass humans in accuracy for the grammatical condition, they underperform in the ungrammatical condition and fluctuate in their responses. Despite significant upgrades in scale, differences persist in terms of stability.\n\nThe study found that LLMs fail to fully reproduce human linguistic behavior, but this is not evidence for innateness in humans or support for any specific theory of innateness. The results suggest that LLMs do not possess the mastery of language at their current stage of development.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Comparability of Human and LLM Evaluation Methods\",\n  \"participants\": \"No specific number or demographics of participants mentioned\",\n  \"study_type\": \"Observational study, comparison of human and LLM evaluation methods\",\n  \"endpoints\": {\n    \"primary\": \"Comparability of human and LLM evaluation methods\",\n    \"secondary\": \"Language abilities of humans vs. models, differences in task performance\"\n  },\n  \"results_summary\": \"LLMs have access to negative evidence, but fail to make use of explicit instructions, raising questions about their ability to identify ungrammatical sentences\",\n  \"methodology\": \"Comparison of human and LLM evaluation methods, analysis of language abilities and task performance\",\n  \"adverse_events\": \"No adverse events mentioned\",\n  \"statistical_analysis\": \"No specific statistical methods or significance mentioned\"\n}\n```\n\nhereby presented challenge this view: the inability of the tested LLMs to adhere to a grammaticality judgment task’s demands suggests that LLMs lack the internal mechanisms that allow humans to naturally tell grammatical and ungrammatical stimuli apart [79]\n\nThe study found that ChatGPT-4 outperformed humans in one experimental condition, but did not perform better in the ungrammatical condition. LLMs' linguistic behavior was not comparable to that of humans, despite the vast amount of data they were trained on.\n\nThe study found that large language models can dissociate language and thought, but the results are not conclusive.\n\nThe study found that neural language models can learn to represent syntactic state, but the accuracy of these representations is limited.\n\nThe study explores the ability of language models to follow instructions with human feedback. The results show that language models can be trained to follow instructions, but the quality of the feedback is crucial for achieving good performance.\n\nThe study discusses the limitations of large language models in understanding human language and the world behind words.",
