FOLLOW-UP STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================

Based on the clinical trial data provided, here are 4 valuable follow-up studies that could advance this research:

1. Long-term Stability Analysis Study
- Focus: Investigate the stability of LLM responses over extended periods and multiple iterations
- Key Elements:
  * Larger sample size of test cases
  * Multiple testing intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)
  * Analysis of whether model updates affect stability
  * Comparison across different versions of the same LLM

2. Cross-linguistic Grammaticality Study
- Focus: Expand testing to multiple languages and cross-linguistic phenomena
- Key Elements:
  * Include languages with different syntactic structures
  * Test grammaticality judgments in bilingual contexts
  * Evaluate transfer learning across languages
  * Compare performance on universal vs. language-specific grammar rules

3. Complex Grammar Phenomena Study
- Focus: Evaluate LLM performance on more sophisticated grammatical structures
- Key Elements:
  * Include complex embedded clauses
  * Test garden path sentences
  * Evaluate context-dependent grammaticality
  * Analyze performance on ambiguous constructions
  * Compare with specialized linguistics experts rather than general human performance

4. Instruction Optimization Study
- Focus: Investigate how different prompting strategies affect grammaticality judgment accuracy
- Key Elements:
  * Compare various instruction formats
  * Test effects of examples and few-shot learning
  * Evaluate impact of explicit rule statements
  * Analyze whether different prompting strategies can improve performance on ungrammatical sentences
  * Include control for potential prompt leakage between models

These studies address key limitations in the current research, particularly the need for more comprehensive evaluation of model stability, linguistic coverage, and instruction methodology.
